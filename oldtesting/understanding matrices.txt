UNDERSTANDING MATRICES

YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

pushmatrix = copied matrix 0 creating matrix 1
rotate/transform = set the change
draw objects change is to be applied to
push matrix = copied matrix 1 including its rotation
rotate1/transform1 = set more change
draw objects both changes is to be applied to
etc etc

FOR ME

push matrix
draw 1-17
rotate
draw 18-26
flip display
